keepalive channels per backend?
mm_backend_start might get some arguments so they don't have to fetch them all the time
Note source in channel value struct

mm_managed_fd.impl is not freed currently (and is heaped most of the time anyway) -> documentation

installer: implement an upgrade mode (check for newer versions in the repo)
